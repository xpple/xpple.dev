        <h1>Frequently Anticipated Questions</h1>
        <h2>What am I looking at?</h2>
        <p>
            You're looking at a command-line interface (CLI), which is an interface in which you can write and execute... commands! But this one isn't like the others, this one is made by me! The purpose of this CLI isn't anything serious or useful. The commands are mostly for entertainment.
        </p>
        <h2>Do you keep track of the commands I execute?</h2>
        <p>
            No. Since I only use Javascript, the commands you execute are executed on your end.

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>whoami</h2>
        <p>
            I'm xpple, also known as Fred. I mostly code in Java and JavaScript, but I've done a bit of everything. I wouldn't consider myself particularly good at any of these languages, but I find it enjoyable to code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently study applied mathematics, which is something I enjoy too.
