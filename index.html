        <h1>Frequently Anticipated Questions</h1>
        <h2>What am I looking at?</h2>
        <p>
            You're looking at a command-line interface (CLI), which is an interface in which you can write and execute... commands! But this one isn't like the others, this one is made by me! The purpose of this CLI isn't anything serious or useful. The commands are mostly for entertainment. The changes you make to the file system are stored in your browser's local storage.
        </p>
        <h2>Do you keep track of the commands I execute?</h2>
        <p>
            No. Since I only use JavaScript (TypeScript), the commands you execute are executed on your end. You can view the source code <a href="https://github.com/xpple/xpple.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>whoami</h2>
        <p>
            I'm xpple, also known as Fred. I mostly code in Java, but I have experience with almost anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics. I obtained this degree at the Delft University of Technology. Now I am studying for a master's degree in computer science (also at the TU Delft). To bridge the gap between the fields, I had to take a premaster's programme of a year. If you're interested in my bachelor's thesis, see the <a href="https://github.com/xpple/ConstructionOfMathematics/" target="_blank">Construction of Mathematics</a> project.
