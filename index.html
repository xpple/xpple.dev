        <h1>Frequently Anticipated Questions</h1>
        <h2>What am I looking at?</h2>
        <p>
            You're looking at a command-line interface (CLI), which is an interface in which you can write and execute... commands! But this one isn't like the others, this one is made by me! The purpose of this CLI isn't anything serious or useful. The commands are mostly for entertainment. The changes you make to the file system are stored in your browser's local storage.
        </p>
        <h2>Do you keep track of the commands I execute?</h2>
        <p>
            No. Since I only use JavaScript (TypeScript), the commands you execute are executed on your end. You can view the source code <a href="https://github.com/xpple/xpple.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

        <p>
            I'm currently in my third year of university. I study Applied Mathematics at the TU Delft, which I quite enjoy. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I plan to follow a bridging program to get a Master's degree in Computer Science.
